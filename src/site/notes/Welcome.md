## The Setting

This adventure is set in official setting of "The Forgotten Realms". The Forgotten Realms or The Realms is has the most detail in it than any other D&D setting. It was made back in 1967 and thousands of people have contributed to it over the years. More than 10,000 books have been published using it so, truly a gargantuan amount. 

The Realms encompass the world of Abeir-Toril (usually just called Toril) meaning "Cradle of life" in an ancient and forgotten language, an Earth-like planet with many large continents. These Continents are named as follows:
- **[Faerûn](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Faer%C3%BBn "Faerûn")**: The westernmost portion of Toril's central supercontinent, a diverse landscape inhabited by numerous races and cultures, including [humans](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Human "Human"), [dwarves](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Dwarf "Dwarf"), [elves](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Elf "Elf"), [halflings](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Halfling "Halfling"), and [gnomes](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Gnome "Gnome").[[6\|6]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril#cite_note-FRCS2e-p4-6)

- **[Maztica](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Maztica "Maztica")**: Primitive cultures bound by duty to their gods gave blood sacrifices in return for power while those who disagreed with the practice struggled to survive.[[10\|10]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril#cite_note-FRCS2e-p5-10)
- **[Anchorome](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Anchorome "Anchorome")**: Hardly explored, seemingly populated with violent elves and more of the humans found in Maztica.[[9\|9]](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Toril#cite_note-G&G-p10-9)
