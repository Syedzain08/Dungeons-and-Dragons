[[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]'s Town Hall serves as the administrative center of this frontier settlement. The building, while not grand, stands out with its purposeful architecture and the occasional flutter of official notices posted near its entrance.

Inside, the most notable feature is the job board - a beacon of opportunity for adventurers. Here, brave souls can find various quests, each promising danger, excitement, and, of course, rewards. The board is regularly updated, reflecting the ever-changing needs of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]] and its surroundings.

The Town Hall is also where one might encounter [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Harbin Wester\|Harbin Wester]], the town master. Known for his peculiar mannerisms and occasional formal attire (as evidenced by his tuxedo-clad appearance when expecting [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra Gwynn]]), Wester manages the town's affairs from this hub of local governance.
