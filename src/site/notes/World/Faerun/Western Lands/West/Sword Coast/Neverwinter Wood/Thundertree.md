Thundertree stands as a skeletal monument to a bygone era. Crumbling stone buildings, once homes and shops, jut from the earth like broken teeth. Vines, thick as a man's arm, snake their way through the decaying structures, reclaiming them for the verdant embrace of the forest. Trees, some as old as the town itself, have pushed through walls and roofs, their roots twisting through abandoned hearths and forgotten doorways.

An unnatural silence hangs heavy over Thundertree, broken only by the rustle of leaves and the occasional screech of a scavenging bird. The air carries the faint scent of decay, a stark contrast to the fresh, pine-scented breeze wafting from the nearby [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Neverwinter Wood/Neverwinter Wood\|Neverwinter Wood]].

In the center of the settlement, a weathered stone tower casts a long, ominous shadow. Jagged cracks spiderweb across its surface, and a collapsed roof reveals a gaping maw to the sky. A single, moss-covered cottage huddles at its base, seemingly defying the ravages of time.

A sense of unease permeates the ruins. An unseen force hangs heavy in the air, a chilling reminder of the disaster that befell Thundertree. Whispers speak of tremors that shook the very foundations of the town, and of an unnatural fire that consumed everything in its path. Some say the earth itself is tainted, cursed by a forgotten magic.

Yet, even in this desolate place, a strange resilience persists. Wildflowers bloom defiantly amongst the rubble, and small animals flit through the ruins, finding new homes in the wreckage. In the heart of the tower, a gnarled tree, its branches reaching towards the sky, stands as a symbol of nature's enduring power.

Thundertree beckons to the curious and the foolhardy alike. Its secrets lie hidden amongst the ruins, waiting for those brave enough to unearth them. But beware, for the dangers that lurk in these shadows are as ancient and relentless as the forest itself.
