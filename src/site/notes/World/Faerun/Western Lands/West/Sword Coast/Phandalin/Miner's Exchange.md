Cool efficiency reigns in the [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]] Miner's Exchange, where [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Miner's Exchange/Halia Thornton\|Halia Thornton]] oversees the lifeblood of the town's economy. The clink of coin and the scratch of quill on parchment form a constant backdrop as miners and merchants conduct their business. Halia moves through the exchange with calculated grace, her steely eyes missing nothing, her carefully chosen words shaping the ebb and flow of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]'s fortunes.
