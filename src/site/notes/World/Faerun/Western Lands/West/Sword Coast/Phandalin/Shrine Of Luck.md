Nestled amongst the rough-hewn buildings of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]] sits the Shrine of Luck, a beacon of hope in this frontier town. Sunlight filters through a stained-glass window, casting vibrant hues onto worn stone walls. The air hums with a quiet reverence, a stark contrast to the hustle and bustle of the central square.

Steps worn smooth by countless pilgrims lead to a low pedestal where a worn silver disc rests. Carved upon its surface is the image of Tymora, the goddess of fortune, her face eternally skyward and a gentle smile playing on her lips.

Sweet-smelling incense curls from a bronze brazier, filling the air with a calming scent. Pots overflowing with vibrant flowers, tended with loving care, line the walls, adding pops of color to the otherwise simple interior.

On the right side, a few well-worn benches offer a place for weary travelers to rest their tired bones and offer a silent prayer to Tymora for safe passage and good fortune. A basin of cool, clear water sits beside them, its surface reflecting the dancing sunlight filtering through the window.

A faint scent of parchment and dried herbs hangs in the air, hinting at the scholarly pursuits of the shrine's caretaker. While the building itself may be small, the atmosphere within radiates a sense of peace and quiet solace, a welcome respite for those seeking a moment of calm amidst the chaos of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]].

but, the acolyte that resides there, sister garael, is out of town at the moment and it is not open.
