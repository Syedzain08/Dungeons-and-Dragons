Nestled on the outskirts of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]], the Trecendor Manor stands as a testament to old wealth and new frontier ambitions. This grand house, with its manicured gardens and gleaming windows, seems almost out of place in the rugged landscape. Yet it's here that the Trecendor family has chosen to make their mark on the burgeoning town. The family members include:
