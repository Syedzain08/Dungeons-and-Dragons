Icy Spire Peak, a jagged tooth of white piercing the azure sky, dominates the landscape around [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]. Its slopes, perpetually cloaked in snow and ice, glitter menacingly in the afternoon sun. A treacherous path, switchbacking along treacherous cliffs, leads up to a forbidding fortress carved into the mountainside.

The wind howls a constant, mournful song across the peak, whipping snow into swirling tendrils that obscure the fortress' true form. Jagged gargoyles, carved from the very rock of the mountain, leer down at any who dare approach. Ominous creaking echoes from within the fortress, hinting at secrets hidden beneath layers of ice and stone.

Legends whisper of a fearsome white dragon, [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Cryovain\|Cryovain]] the Terror, who has made his lair within the peak. Its breath, a blast of arctic wind, can freeze a man solid in seconds. Talons like scimitars and a hide as tough as steel make [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Cryovain\|Cryovain]] a terrifying foe.

But the dangers of Ice Spire Peak extend beyond the dragon's wrath. The treacherous slopes are prone to avalanches, and hidden crevasses threaten to swallow the unwary whole. The bitter cold seeps into the bones, a constant enemy for those who dare to climb.

Despite the dangers, the peak holds a strange allure. Adventurers, lured by the promise of treasure or driven by a thirst for glory, attempt the perilous ascent. Some seek to slay the dragon and claim its hoard, while others hope to uncover the secrets of the ancient fortress.

Yet, few return from Icy Spire Peak unscathed. The mountain itself seems to hold a malevolent power, testing the limits of even the most seasoned adventurer.
