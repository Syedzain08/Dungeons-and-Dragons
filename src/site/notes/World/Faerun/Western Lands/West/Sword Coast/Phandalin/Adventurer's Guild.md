The Adventurer's Guild stands as a beacon of opportunity and excitement in [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]], its weathered exterior belying the wealth of knowledge and potential for adventure within. The building hums with a constant undercurrent of activity, from the scratch of quills on parchment to the animated discussions of would-be heroes planning their next quests.

At the heart of this organized chaos presides [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Thaelar Moonwhisper\|Thaelar Moonwhisper]], an elderly elf whose very presence commands respect. His wizened face, etched with the lines of countless centuries, is dominated by eyes that seem to pierce through any facade. One eye, a deep forest green, twinkles with wisdom and mirth. The other, a swirling opalescent orb, is said to see through even the rarest of illusions.

Thaelar's slender frame is draped in robes of midnight blue, adorned with silver runes that shimmer in the candlelight. His long, silver hair is meticulously braided, cascading down his back like a moonlit waterfall. Wire-rimmed spectacles perch perpetually on the end of his aquiline nose, pushed up with a gnarled finger as he pores over guild documents.

When Thaelar speaks, it's with a voice like aged oak - deep, resonant, and carrying the weight of millennia. His words are few but carefully chosen, each syllable imbued with layers of meaning. Despite his intimidating gaze, a gentle smile often plays at the corners of his mouth, especially when guiding young adventurers through the intricacies of guild paperwork.

Flanking Thaelar are two women whose contrasting energies bring balance to the guild's front desk. To his right stands [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Brenna Thornheart\|Brenna Thornheart]], the guild's resident herbologist. Her warm brown eyes sparkle with an innate connection to growing things, and her curly auburn hair seems perpetually adorned with leaves or flower petals. Brenna's hands, calloused from work in her gardens, move with surprising delicacy as she measures out herbal remedies or assists with guild administration.

Brenna's voice carries the lilt of distant meadows, her words often interspersed with fascinating tidbits about the medicinal properties of local flora. Her laugh, bright and infectious, can often be heard ringing through the guild hall, a balm to weary adventurers.

To Thaelar's left is [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Lyra Oakenbough\|Lyra Oakenbough]], the guild's master carpenter and all-around craftswoman. Her muscular frame speaks of a life spent shaping wood and stone, while her honey-blonde hair is often tied back in a practical bun. Lyra's hazel eyes hold a spark of creativity, seeing potential masterpieces in every block of wood or stone.

Lyra's hands are a roadmap of her craft, strong and scarred, yet capable of incredible precision. When she speaks, it's with a voice as smooth and rich as polished mahogany, often accompanied by animated gestures as she explains the intricacies of her latest project or helps decode a treasure map.

Together, this trio forms the beating heart of the Adventurer's Guild. Thaelar's ancient wisdom, Brenna's nurturing spirit, and Lyra's practical creativity blend seamlessly, providing guidance, support, and inspiration to all who seek adventure in and around [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]].
