The Adventurer's Guild stands as a beacon of opportunity and excitement in [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]], its weathered exterior belying the wealth of knowledge and potential for adventure within. The building hums with a constant undercurrent of activity, from the scratch of quills on parchment to the animated discussions of would-be heroes planning their next quests.

At the heart of this organized chaos presides [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adventurer's Guild/Thaelar Moonwhisper\|Thaelar Moonwhisper]], an elderly elf whose very presence commands respect. 

Flanking Thaelar are two women whose contrasting energies bring balance to the guild's front desk. To his right stands [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adventurer's Guild/Brenna Thornheart\|Brenna Thornheart]], the guild's resident herbologist. 

To Thaelar's left is [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adventurer's Guild/Lyra Oakenbough\|Lyra Oakenbough]], the guild's master carpenter and all-around craftswoman. 

Together, this trio forms the beating heart of the Adventurer's Guild. Thaelar's ancient wisdom, Brenna's nurturing spirit, and Lyra's practical creativity blend seamlessly, providing guidance, support, and inspiration to all who seek adventure in and around [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]].
