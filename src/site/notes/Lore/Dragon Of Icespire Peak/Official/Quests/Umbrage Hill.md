Umbrage Hill, located approximately half a day's walk from [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]], is home to a solitary windmill inhabited by [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra Gwynn]], an alchemist or healer of some renown. The hill's proximity to [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]] makes it an accessible location for those seeking [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra]]'s services or those tasked with ensuring her safety.

## Our Party's Adventure

Our party's visit to Umbrage Hill was marked by a dramatic encounter with a fearsome [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Manticore\|Manticore]]. The beast was attempting to break into [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra]]'s windmill, intent on making a meal of its occupant. Through their combined efforts, our heroes managed to defeat the [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Manticore\|Manticore]], saving [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra Gwynn]] from a grisly fate.

Despite the imminent danger posed by the recently arrived white dragon, [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Cryovain\|Cryovain]], [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra Gwynn]] was initially reluctant to leave her home. Her hesitation stemmed not only from attachment to her dwelling but also from a desire to avoid the romantic advances of [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Harbin Wester\|Harbin Wester]] in Phandalin. It took some convincing (and a bit of forceful persuasion) from our party to ensure Adabra's safety by removing her from the isolated windmill.

In gratitude for their timely rescue, [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra Gwynn]] gifted the party with a healing potion. More significantly, she agreed to join the group as an ally, potentially offering her alchemical skills and knowledge to aid in future adventures. [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra]]'s connections to the Order of the Knights in Phandalin may also prove valuable in the party's ongoing quests.

While the immediate threat of the [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Manticore\|Manticore]] has been eliminated, Umbrage Hill and its surroundings remain under the shadow of [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Cryovain\|Cryovain]], the white dragon. Adventurers traveling in this area should remain alert to potential dangers, both from natural predators and the looming draconic threat.
