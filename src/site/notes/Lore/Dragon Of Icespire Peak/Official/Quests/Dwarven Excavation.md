This site offers a tantalizing glimpse into the rich history and craftsmanship of dwarven civilization. The excavation is overseen by two dwarf prospectors, Dazzlin and Norbus, who have been exploring the ruins.

## Our Party's Adventure

Our party's adventure at the Dwarven Excavation was fraught with danger and discovery. Upon entering the site, they encountered two formidable [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Ochre Jelly\|Ochre Jellies]], which they bravely defeated. As they delved deeper into the ruins, they uncovered a mysterious puzzle involving a pillar with three holes. Solving this puzzle unleashed a cascade of dwarven skulls, hinting at the site's dark history.

Further exploration led to the discovery of a trapped room containing a skeleton clutching a dagger inscribed with the words "Greed is good." This room also presented a riddle: "32 horses on a hill, first they stamp, then they stomp, then they stand still." The answer, "Teeth," when given, triggered a series of booby traps. The party's quick thinking and reflexes allowed them to escape with their lives as the cavern began to collapse around them.

Despite the perils, the excavation yielded valuable rewards. The party obtained two sending stones from Dazzlin and Norbus as a reward for defeating the [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Ochre Jelly\|Ochre Jellies]]. They also discovered a red chest containing 12 sapphire gems, each worth 10 gold pieces. However, the site's dangers extend beyond its interior, as evidenced by an [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Official/Monsters/Orc\|Orc]] attack outside the excavation, reminding adventurers to remain vigilant even after exiting the ruins.
