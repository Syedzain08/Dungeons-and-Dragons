The patriarch of the family, Lord Adrien Trecendor, is a man whose very presence commands attention. Tall and lean, with salt-and-pepper hair swept back from a high forehead, Adrien carries himself with the easy grace of nobility. His steel-gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to assess the value of everything and everyone they fall upon.

Adrien's voice is a cultured baritone, equally suited to boardroom negotiations and frontier town council meetings. His hands, though manicured, bear the calluses of one not afraid to do his own dirty work when necessary. A former adventurer turned merchant prince, Adrien sees Phandalin as his greatest investment yet.

Despite his sometimes cold demeanor, Adrien harbors a deep love for his family and a genuine desire to see Phandalin prosper â€“ though always with the Trecendor name at the forefront.
