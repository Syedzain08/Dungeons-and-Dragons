Toblen Stonehill, a man whose stature belies his oversized presence in [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]'s daily life. Standing barely over five feet, Toblen's compact frame speaks of a life spent navigating the tight spaces behind a busy bar. His blonde hair, peppered with gray at the temples, is often slightly mussed, as if he's just run his fingers through it in contemplation of his next brew.

Toblen's eyes, a warm brown that crinkle at the corners, seem to twinkle with the reflection of a thousand hearth fires. His gentle smile, quick to appear and slow to fade, has soothed many a troubled soul. When he speaks, his voice resonates with a depth that surprises many, carrying the warmth of fresh-baked bread and the comfort of a well-worn armchair. A slight country twang colors his words, a remnant of a youth spent in the rolling hills beyond [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]'s borders.

His hands, calloused and strong, move with practiced ease as he pours drinks, each motion a small work of art honed over decades. Toblen has an uncanny knack for remembering not just names and faces, but the preferred drinks and favorite tales of every patron who's ever crossed his threshold. He listens more than he speaks, but when he does offer advice, it's with the measured wisdom of one who's heard every story the road has to tell.

In quieter moments, Toblen can be seen absently polishing a mug or straightening the bottles behind the bar, his eyes distant as if seeing beyond the inn's walls to the wider world beyond. It's in these moments that newcomers might glimpse the adventurous spirit that once led a young man to settle in this frontier town, now tempered by years of watching others come and go.

Toblen Stonehill is more than just an innkeeper; he's the steadfast heart of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]], his establish
ment a second home to many and a first glimpse of civilization to others. In his gentle presence, seasoned adventurers find a reminder of what they fight to protect, and young dreamers glimpse the wonders that await beyond the horizon.
