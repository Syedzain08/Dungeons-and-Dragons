Kristen Blooms is a whirlwind of enthusiasm barely contained in a child's form. Her round face, dominated by large, wonder-filled eyes, is almost always split by a wide, infectious grin. Freckles dance across her nose and cheeks, shifting with each animated expression.

Her hair, a riot of copper curls, seems to have a life of its own, escaping any attempt at containment. Kristen's clothes, while clean, often bear the evidence of her latest misadventure â€“ a smudge of armor polish here, a scorch mark from an overenthusiastic demonstration there.

When she speaks, her voice fluctuates wildly between childish excitement and comical attempts to mimic Linene's authoritative tone. Her hands gesticulate wildly as she talks, often knocking over nearby objects in her exuberance.

Kristen turns every task into an epic quest, her imagination transforming the armory into a dragon's lair or a knight's stronghold. Her clumsiness is legendary, but her heart is pure gold, making her impossible not to adore.
