![Martha Stonehill.webp](/img/user/Images/Characters/npcs/Phandalin/Stonehill%20Inn/Martha%20Stonehill.webp)

The aroma of Martha Stonehill's cooking precedes her, a siren call to hungry travelers that wafts through the inn's common room and out into the streets of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]. Martha herself is a formidable presence, her robust frame speaking of a life spent nurturing others and wrestling stubborn cookpots into submission. Standing a head taller than most patrons, with shoulders broadened by years of kneading dough and hauling water, Martha cuts an imposing figure as she emerges from her kitchen domain.

Her face, round and flushed from the heat of the ovens, is a map of a life well-lived. Laugh lines crinkle around her eyes and mouth, deep furrows that speak of a woman quick to smile despite the daily trials of running an inn. Her eyes, a warm chestnut brown, possess a keen sharpness that misses little, from a patron's empty mug to a homesick traveler in need of comfort food.

Martha's hair, a rich black streaked liberally with silver, is usually confined in a no-nonsense bun at the nape of her neck. Wisps often escape to frame her face, lending her a softness that belies her stern demeanor. Her hands, rough and reddened from constant work, move with surprising grace whether she's crimping a pie crust or gently shooing a stray cat from the kitchen.

When Martha speaks, it's with a voice that brooks no argument from rowdy patrons or lazy staff. Her accent mirrors that of [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Elmar Barthen\|Barthen]], the local shopkeeper, hinting at a shared history beyond [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]'s borders. There's a musical quality to her speech, reminiscent of "Aunt Petunia," that becomes particularly pronounced when she's scolding someone – which is often. Yet, beneath the bluster lies a current of affection; her reprimands are as much a sign of care as her hearty meals.

Martha's attire is practical – sturdy dresses in muted colors, protected by a perpetually flour-dusted apron that's seen better days. A collection of wooden spoons pokes out from her apron pocket, as much tools of discipline as of cooking. She moves with purpose through the inn, her stride long and determined, the floorboards creaking in familiar protest beneath her weight.

In quieter moments, Martha can be found at a corner table, a mug of strong tea at her elbow, mending linens or poring over a dog-eared recipe book. Her brow furrows in concentration, and she often mutters to herself, planning menus or working out new concoctions to satisfy the varied palates of her patrons.

Despite her gruff exterior, Martha's maternal instincts extend to every soul who crosses the inn's threshold. She has an uncanny knack for knowing when a traveler needs a bowl of hearty stew to ward off homesickness, or when a mug of sweet cider will soothe a child's fears. Her kitchen is her realm, and from it, she dispenses not just meals, but comfort, healing, and a taste of home to all who visit the [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn\|Stonehill Inn]].

Martha Stonehill is more than just the inn's cook and cleaner; she is its backbone, its nurturer, and in many ways, the true mother of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]. In her capable hands, weary adventurers find respite, lonely souls find comfort, and all who enter the Stonehill Inn discover the true meaning of hospitality.
