Ander Silkans moves through [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Barthen's Provisions\|Barthen's Provisions]] with an ethereal grace that belies his centuries of experience. This tall, slender elf brings an air of timeless efficiency to the frontier store. Ander's most striking feature is his hair, which cascades down his back like spun gold, catching the light in mesmerizing ways as he works.

His eyes are a marvel in themselves, shifting from deep forest green to warm amber depending on the light and his mood. These hues seem to dance as Ander's gaze flits from task to task, missing no detail in his quest for perfect order.

Ander's slender fingers move with uncanny speed and precision, whether he's restocking shelves, wrapping parcels, or penning inventory lists. His movements are so fluid they almost seem choreographed, turning mundane tasks into something akin to an elegant performance.

Always impeccably dressed in pressed clothes that somehow never wrinkle despite his constant activity, Ander embodies the elven ideal of effortless perfection. His voice, when he chooses to use it, is soft and melodious, often completing his twin's sentences before she can finish them.

Ander's presence brings a touch of magic to the simple act of commerce, his elven heritage a living reminder of the wonder that still exists in the world.
