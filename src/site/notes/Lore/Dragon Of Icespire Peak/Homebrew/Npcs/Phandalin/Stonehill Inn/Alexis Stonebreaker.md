![Alexis Stonebreaker.jpg](/img/user/Images/Characters/npcs/Phandalin/Stonehill%20Inn/Alexis%20Stonebreaker.jpg)

Where her sister is a gale, Alexis Stonebreaker is the calm at its center, moving through the [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn\|Stonehill Inn]] with quiet purpose and understated grace. Of average height and slender build, Alexis nonetheless has a presence that commands attention, not through volume or motion, but through the intensity of her focused gaze and economical movements.

Alexis shares her twin's striking white hair, though she wears hers in a neat, practical braid that hangs down her back. Occasionally, a few wisps escape to frame her face, softening her otherwise composed appearance. Her most arresting feature, however, are her eyes – a soft, ethereal pink that seems to shift in hue depending on the light and her mood. These unusual eyes observe the inn's goings-on with quiet intensity, missing little and revealing less.

Her skin is pale, almost porcelain-like, a testament to her preference for the inn's shadowed corners over the bustling brightness of the common room. A light dusting of freckles across her nose and cheeks serves as a gentle reminder of her connection to [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn/Tayla Stonebreaker\|Tayla]], a subtle mark of their shared heritage.

Alexis moves with purpose, her actions precise and efficient. Her hands, though as calloused as her sister's from years of work, possess a delicate dexterity that's evident in the way she handles fragile glassware or pens neat figures in the inn's ledger. She has a habit of absently tracing the wood grain of the bar when deep in thought, her fingers moving in hypnotic patterns.

When Alexis speaks, it's rarely above a murmur, her voice a soft counterpoint to the inn's bustle. Like her sister, her accent carries hints of British inflection mixed with country twang, but where [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn/Tayla Stonebreaker\|Tayla]]'s words tumble out in a rush, Alexis' are measured and deliberate. Those who lean in to listen find a wit as sharp as a newly-honed blade, her rare comments often cutting to the heart of matters with uncanny precision.

Alexis has a gift for numbers and an eye for detail that makes her an invaluable asset to the inn's operations. She can often be seen at the bar, quill in hand, balancing the books with a focus that borders on meditation. In these moments, a small furrow appears between her brows, and she absently tucks loose strands of hair behind her ear – a gesture eerily similar to her twin's.

Despite her reserved nature, Alexis is not without warmth. Her smiles, though rare, transform her entire countenance, lighting up her face and revealing a hidden dimple in her left cheek. She has a particular softness for the inn's feline residents, and observant patrons might catch her slipping treats to the cats that slink around the common room.

Alexis Stonebreaker embodies the quieter side of the [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn\|Stonehill Inn]]'s hospitality. In her silent efficiency and keen observations, patrons find a different kind of welcome – one that speaks to the depth and complexity that lies beneath [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]'s rugged exterior. She is the inn's secret keeper, its silent guardian, and a reminder that still waters often run unfathomably deep.
