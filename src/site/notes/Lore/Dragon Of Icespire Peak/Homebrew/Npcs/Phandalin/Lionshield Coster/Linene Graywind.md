Linene Graywind stands as straight and proud as the weapons she sells, her bearing that of a warrior queen overseeing her armory. Her long brown hair, is usually bound in a severe braid that accentuates her sharp cheekbones and penetrating gaze.

Spectacles perch on her aquiline nose, flashing like polished shields as she assesses each customer. Her voice, cultured and precise, can cut through the din of the shop or soften to a conspiratorial whisper when discussing the finer points of weaponry.

Linene's attire is a blend of practical leatherwork and finer fabrics, always impeccably maintained. Her hands, though bearing the calluses of one familiar with weaponry, move with delicate precision whether handling a delicate dagger or penning orders to far-off suppliers.

In Linene Graywind, the practicality of a merchant meets the honor of a warrior, each transaction a step towards arming [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]] against the dangers that lurk beyond its borders.
