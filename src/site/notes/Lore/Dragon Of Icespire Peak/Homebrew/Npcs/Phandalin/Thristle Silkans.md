Thristle Silkans brings a vibrant energy to [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Barthen's Provisions\|Barthen's Provisions]] that perfectly complements his twin's serene efficiency. More compact than Ander but no less graceful, Thristle moves through the store with a buoyant enthusiasm that seems to lift the spirits of all around him.

His most distinctive feature is his cropped silver mane, which seems to sparkle with its own inner light. The short style, unusual for an elf, gives him a more approachable air, framing his angular features and accentuating his expressive eyes, which shine with mirth and ancient wisdom in equal measure.

Thristle's laugh, hearty and melodious, often fills the store, turning the mundane atmosphere of commerce into something altogether more magical. His voice carries a musical lilt, and he has a habit of humming elven melodies as he works, adding an otherworldly soundtrack to the day's business.

Like his brother, Thristle moves with uncanny grace and speed, anticipating the needs of customers and his fellow shopkeepers before they're even voiced. His hands dance over products and coin alike, managing transactions with a dexterity honed over centuries.

Thristle's attire, always a perfect match to his brother's, somehow remains pristine despite his constant motion. He brings a sense of joy and wonder to his work, his very presence a reminder of the magic that underpins the seemingly ordinary world of frontier commerce.

Together, [[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Ander Silkans\|Ander]] and Thristle transform the simple general store into a place of subtle enchantment, their synchronized movements and complementary personalities creating an atmosphere of efficiency and wonder that leaves a lasting impression on all who visit Barthen's Provisions.
