Lyra's muscular frame speaks of a life spent shaping wood and stone, while her silver- hair is often tied back in a practical bun. Lyra's red eyes hold a spark of creativity, seeing potential masterpieces in every block of wood or stone.

Lyra's hands are a roadmap of her craft, strong and scarred, yet capable of incredible precision. When she speaks, it's with a voice as smooth and rich as polished mahogany, often accompanied by animated gestures as she explains the intricacies of her latest project or helps decode a treasure map.
