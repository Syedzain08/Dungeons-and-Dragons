Where Adrien is all sharp edges and ambition, his wife Elara is warmth and diplomacy personified. A half-elf of surpassing beauty, Elara's ageless features are framed by flowing auburn hair often adorned with simple yet elegant jewels. Her eyes, a mesmerizing mix of gold and green, seem to hold secrets of both elven forests and human cities.

Elara moves through the manor and town with effortless grace, her melodious voice and tinkling laugh a balm to frayed nerves and wounded pride. A gifted herbalist and healer, she often opens the manor's gardens to those in need, much to her husband's carefully hidden pride.

Though many see her as merely a socialite, Elara's keen mind and centuries of observation make her a formidable political force in her own right, often smoothing over the rough edges of her husband's ambitions.
