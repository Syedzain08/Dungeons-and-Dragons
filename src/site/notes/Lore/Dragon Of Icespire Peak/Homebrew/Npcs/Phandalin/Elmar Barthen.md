![Elmar Barthen.jpg](/img/user/Images/Characters/npcs/Phandalin/Barthen's%20Provisions/Elmar%20Barthen.jpg)

Elmar Barthen is the beating heart of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]'s commerce, his general store a reflection of the man himself: orderly, practical, and unexpectedly deep. His lean frame, slightly stooped from years of leaning over counters and ledgers, moves with deliberate purpose through the aisles of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Barthen's Provisions\|Barthen's Provisions]]. 

Elmar's face is a roadmap of mercantile adventures, each wrinkle a story waiting to be told. His balding pate, fringed by salt-and-pepper hair, gleams in the lamplight as he pores over inventory lists. Dark, intelligent eyes peer out from behind wire-rimmed spectacles, missing nothing and weighing everything.

His voice, raspy like pages in an old book, imparts not just the price of goods but nuggets of wisdom to those who linger. Elmar's hands, spotted with age but steady, move with practiced ease as he weighs spices or measures cloth. A faded ink stain on his right index finger is a permanent badge of his trade.

In Elmar Barthen, the practicality of a seasoned merchant meets the soul of a frontier dreamer, each sale a small step towards [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]'s prosperous future.
