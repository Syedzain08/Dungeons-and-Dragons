![Sister Garaele.jpg](/img/user/Images/Characters/npcs/Phandalin/Shrine%20Of%20Luck/Sister%20Garaele.jpg)

Enigmatic as the goddess she serves, Sister Garaele seems to float rather than walk through [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]. Her elven features, timeless and serene, are framed by silver-blonde hair that cascades down her back like a moonlit waterfall. Her eyes, a deep and shifting blue, seem to look beyond the physical world.

Sister Garaele's robes, a soft gray embroidered with subtle symbols of Tymora, whisper as she moves. Her slender hands often cradle a string of prayer beads, fingers moving in rhythmic patterns as she contemplates the mysteries of fate.

When she speaks, it's in tones that would suit the noblest courts, her voice musical and soothing. Yet her words are often couched in riddles and parables, leaving listeners pondering long after she's gone. A faint scent of incense and old books seems to linger in her wake.

In Sister Garaele, the people of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]] find both guidance and mystery, her presence a reminder of the greater forces at work in their lives.
