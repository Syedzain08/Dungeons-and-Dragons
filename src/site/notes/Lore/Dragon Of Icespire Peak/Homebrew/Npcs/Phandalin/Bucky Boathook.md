![Bucky Boathook.jpg](/img/user/Images/Characters/npcs/Stonehill%20Inn/Bucky%20Boathook.jpg)

A splash of exotic color in [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]'s earthy palette, Bucky Boathook stands out like a tropical bird amidst sparrows. Of middling height but wiry build, Bucky moves with the rolling gait of a lifelong sailor, even on the solid ground of the [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn\|Stonehill Inn]]. His weathered skin, tanned to leather by sun and salt, is a canvas of stories – scars from unknown adventures, laugh lines as deep as harbor channels, and a collection of tattoos that peek out from beneath his colorful garb.

Bucky's most striking feature is his hair – a wild, unkempt mane that seems to defy gravity, sticking out at odd angles as if permanently windblown. The color is hard to pin down, a sun-bleached mixture of brown, blond, and red that changes hue depending on the light. His eyes, a startling sea-green, twinkle with mischief and secrets, inviting onlookers to lean in closer for the next outrageous tale.

His face is a work of art in asymmetry. A twice-broken nose lists slightly to the left, while his grin – revealing a gold tooth that catches the light when he laughs – pulls to the right, accentuating a single, roguishly charming dimple. A scar bisects his left eyebrow, adding to his rakish appearance.

Bucky's attire is as eclectic as his personality – a patchwork of styles from every port he's ever visited. He favors loose shirts in vibrant patterns, often left partially unbuttoned to reveal a chest festooned with trinkets and good luck charms from a dozen different cultures. His trousers, sturdy sailcloth affairs, are tucked into scuffed boots that have seen better decades. A faded red bandana is perpetually tied around his neck, serving as a handkerchief, a napkin, or an impromptu bandage as the situation demands.

When Bucky speaks, it's with a voice that seems to have soaked up accents from every corner of the world, blending them into a unique patois that's as much music as it is language. His boisterous laugh, a sound like waves crashing against a rocky shore, is as much a fixture of the [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn\|Stonehill]] as its very foundations. He punctuates his speech with grand gestures, his hands – calloused and adorned with an assortment of rings – painting pictures in the air as he spins his tales.

Bucky's stories are legendary in [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]], each more outrageous than the last. He claims to have sailed with pirates, dined with merfolk, and once arm-wrestled a kraken to a standstill. While most dismiss his tales as fanciful exaggerations, there's often a glimmer in his eye that makes listeners wonder if there might be a kernel of truth buried beneath the embellishments.

In quieter moments, Bucky can be found at the bar, a mug of grog in hand, his eyes distant as if seeing beyond the inn's walls to far-off horizons. He has a habit of absently polishing the gleaming hook that replaces his left hand, a souvenir from an adventure he refuses to discuss, deflecting questions with a wink and a change of subject.

Bucky Boathook is more than just a colorful regular at the Stonehill Inn; he's a living reminder of the world beyond [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]'s borders. In his outrageous tales and mysterious past, the townsfolk find both entertainment and a connection to the wider world of adventure that lies just beyond their frontier town.
