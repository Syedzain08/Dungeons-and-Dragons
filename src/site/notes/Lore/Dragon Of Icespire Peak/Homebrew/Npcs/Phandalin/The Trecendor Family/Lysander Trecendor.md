![Lysander Trecendor.jpg](/img/user/Images/Characters/npcs/Phandalin/Trecendor%20Family/Lysander%20Trecendor.jpg)

The eldest child of the Trecendors, Lysander is a young man caught between two worlds. His father's human ambition wars with his mother's elven serenity in his very bones. Tall and lithe, with his mother's auburn hair and his father's steel-gray eyes, Lysander cuts a striking figure.

An accomplished wizard-in-training, Lysander can often be found in the manor's library, poring over ancient tomes or practicing cantrips. His voice, when he chooses to use it, carries the weight of carefully considered words, each syllable precise and measured.

Lysander dreams of using his growing magical prowess to uncover the secrets of the nearby ruins, much to his father's dismay and his mother's quiet encouragement.
