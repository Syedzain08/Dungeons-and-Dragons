![Harbin Wester.jpg](/img/user/Images/Characters/npcs/Phandalin/Harbin%20Wester.jpg)

Harbin Wester fills doorways with his girth and rooms with his nasally pronouncements. His round face, perpetually flushed, is dominated by a bulbous nose that twitches when he's agitated â€“ which is often. Small, watery eyes dart nervously about, as if constantly on the lookout for threats or opportunities.

His fine clothes, always a touch too tight, strain over his ample belly, buttons threatening to pop with each expansive gesture. A thin comb-over does little to disguise his balding pate, and his multiple chins quiver as he speaks.

Harbin's voice, high-pitched and reedy, carries a forced joviality that barely masks his underlying anxiety. His laugh, a nervous titter, often punctuates his sentences, especially when he's trying to assert his authority.

Despite his bluster, a shadow of fear flits across his face at the mere mention of dragons or other dangers, revealing the frightened man beneath the official's robes. His hands, soft and adorned with gaudy rings, often fidget with the mayoral chain around his neck.

In Harbin Wester, [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]] sees both its aspirations and its insecurities personified, a leader whose ambitions often outstrip his capabilities.
