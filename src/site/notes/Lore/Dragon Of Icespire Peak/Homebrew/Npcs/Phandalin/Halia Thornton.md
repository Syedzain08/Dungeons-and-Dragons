Cool and collected as the ore she trades, Halia Thornton is a study in controlled power. Her face, all sharp angles and high cheekbones, rarely betrays emotion beyond a carefully cultivated pleasant neutrality. Her eyes, a steely gray, miss nothing, cataloguing every detail of her surroundings with ruthless efficiency.

Halia's attire is deceptively simple â€“ well-tailored clothes in muted colors that somehow manage to command respect without ostentation. Her hair, a rich brown streaked with silver, is always impeccably styled, not a strand out of place.

When she moves, it's with a calculated grace that speaks of hidden strength and agility. Her voice, smooth as polished stone, can charm or intimidate with equal ease. Each word is carefully chosen, precisely delivered, a verbal chess game where she's always several moves ahead.

In the game of power played beneath [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]'s surface, Halia holds cards she has yet to reveal, her true motives as hidden as the veins of precious ore in the mines she oversees.
