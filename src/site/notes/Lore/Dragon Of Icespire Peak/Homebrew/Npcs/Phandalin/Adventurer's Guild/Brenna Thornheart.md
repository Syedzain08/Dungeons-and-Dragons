![Brenna Thornheart.jpg](/img/user/Images/Characters/npcs/Phandalin/Adventurer's%20Guild/Brenna%20Thornheart.jpg)

Brenna has warm brown eyes sparkle with an innate connection to growing things, and her curly auburn hair seems perpetually adorned with leaves or flower petals. Brenna's hands, calloused from work in her gardens, move with surprising delicacy as she measures out herbal remedies or assists with guild administration.

Brenna's voice carries the lilt of distant meadows, her words often interspersed with fascinating tidbits about the medicinal properties of local flora. Her laugh, bright and infectious, can often be heard ringing through the guild hall, a balm to weary adventurers.
