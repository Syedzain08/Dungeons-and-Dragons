The rhythmic clang of hammer on anvil announces Dwalin Ironhammer's presence long before he comes into view. This stout dwarf is the beating heart of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]'s smithy, his powerful arms and expert craftsmanship keeping the frontier town well-equipped against the dangers of the wild.

Dwalin stands barely over four feet tall, but his broad shoulders and barrel chest give him a presence that fills the smithy. His skin is the ruddy hue of forge-heated metal, weathered and scarred from years of working with flame and iron. A thick, braided beard of deep auburn cascades down his chest, occasionally singed at the edges and invariably containing a few metal shavings that glint in the firelight.

His eyes, a warm amber that seems to reflect the glow of the forge, are set deep under bushy eyebrows permanently furrowed in concentration. Dwalin's nose, broad and slightly crooked from an old break, twitches constantly as if testing the scents of hot metal and coal that permeate his domain.

Dwalin's hands are a testament to his craft - massive, calloused, and scarred, yet capable of surprisingly delicate work when shaping intricate designs or setting precious gems. He moves with the assured grace of one who knows every inch of his workspace, his stocky frame navigating the cramped confines of the smithy with practiced ease.

When Dwalin speaks, it's with a voice as deep and rumbling as distant thunder, his words punctuated by the rhythmic strikes of his hammer. His accent is thick and guttural, a blend of traditional Dwarven cadences and the local [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Sword Coast\|Sword Coast]] dialect. He often grumbles and mutters to himself as he works, carrying on a constant commentary with his tools and materials.

Dwalin's attire is practical and fire-resistant - a heavy leather apron over simple, sturdy clothes, all bearing the marks of sparks and soot. A variety of tools hang from his belt, always within easy reach, clanking softly as he moves about the smithy.

Despite his gruff exterior, Dwalin takes immense pride in his work. His eyes light up with genuine pleasure when discussing the finer points of metallurgy or examining a well-crafted weapon. He has little patience for shoddy workmanship or those who don't appreciate the artistry in a well-forged blade.

In quieter moments, Dwalin can be seen carefully polishing his latest creations, his touch almost gentle as he brings out the luster in the metal. He has a particular soft spot for aspiring young adventurers, often slipping in extra reinforcements or minor enchantments to their gear "for luck," though he'd gruffly deny any such sentimentality if asked directly.

Dwalin Ironhammer is more than just [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]'s blacksmith; he's a living link to the dwarven traditions of old, his craftsmanship a bulwark against the dangers that threaten the frontier town. In the ring of his hammer and the glow of his forge, the people of [[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]] find reassurance that they are well-equipped to face whatever challenges the wild may bring.
