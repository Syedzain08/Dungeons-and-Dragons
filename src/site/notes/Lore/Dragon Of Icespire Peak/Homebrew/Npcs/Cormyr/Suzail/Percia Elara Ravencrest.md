In the grand halls of the royal palace, where whispers carry secrets and every glance holds meaning, one figure stands apart. Percia, a name that sends shivers down the spines of courtiers and petitioners alike, is the immovable pillar beside the Queen-regent's throne.

Known as the Queen's Right Hand, Percia is more than a mere advisor – she is the embodiment of the crown's will made flesh. When the Queen speaks, it is often Percia's words that flow from royal lips. When silence reigns, it is Percia's keen eyes that observe, cataloging every twitch and tell of those who seek audience.

Her privilege to stand beside the throne is unmatched and unquestioned. In a court where proximity to power is currency, Percia is unimaginably wealthy. Yet she wears this honor not as a gaudy jewel, but as a solemn duty etched into her very being.

Percia moves through the palace like a stern winter wind – unstoppable, chilling, and utterly necessary. Her gowns, always in the deepest hues of nobility, whisper against stone floors that have known the tread of kings. The silver pendant at her throat – her house's symbol – catches the light, a reminder to all of the ancient blood that flows in her veins.

To those beneath her station (and in Percia's eyes, this accounts for nearly everyone), she is a fortress of propriety. Her words, when she deigns to speak to lesser folk, are clipped and precise, each syllable polished by generations of refinement. Her arched eyebrow has ended more courtly careers than any royal decree.

Yet to the Queen-regent, Percia shows a loyalty so fierce it borders on the fanatical. In private councils, she is the voice of tradition, of stability, of the old ways that have kept the kingdom strong. She is also the whisper of caution, ever watchful for threats to her Queen's regency.

But even as Percia stands resolute, a quiet unease gnaws at her heart. For she knows that her Queen's reign, and perhaps her own influence, has an expiration date. The true king, whose shadow looms over every decision, every policy, will one day step into the light. On that day, Percia knows, the world she has so carefully maintained will shift beneath her feet.

Until then, she remains vigilant, the stern sentinel beside the throne, her fan snapping open and closed like the wings of a watchful dragon guarding its hoard. In Percia's world, tradition is strength, nobility is duty, and loyalty is everything – no matter the cost.
