**SESSION 3: RECAP**

Our intrepid Heroes find themselves at the Stonehill Inn once again. They decide to explore Phandalin and so they head to The Smithy first thing in the morning. There they meet a Dwarf Blacksmith by the name of Dwalin. They ask about the prices and then leave.

before they can get there a distraught person stops them saying that he needs to sell off his horses to pay his taxes and living expenses. The heroes refuse and he ends up selling the horses to the local Knights.

The heroes follow Dwalin’s directions and go to Barthen’s Provisions, The General Store. There they meet the elderly owner Elmar Barthen and his spritely, full-of-energy employees Thristle and Ander Silkans. The group becomes quite _enchanted_ by their words and buys items at ridiculous prices.

They go to The Town Hall where, on the job board there are two quests left, Gnomengarde and Umbrage Hill. The characters choose Umbrage Hill and set off. Due to the incredible expertise of Will Buyers, they reach the hill in half a day’s walk. They find themselves face to face with a Manticore trying to knock down a windmill to eat its occupant which happens to be Adabra Gwynn, the one they are here to warn. They confront the Manticore and successfully kill it in a long arduous fight.

After saving the day, they throw a rope up to Adabra and she repels down, explicitly stating not to peek, but our hero Lucifer Morningstar does anyway. Adabra also gave them a healing potion for their trouble.

After this, they tell her about the danger of the White Dragon’s presence and she refuses to believe it and says that she does not want to go to Phandalin because Harbin Wester has been pestering her to marry him. Lucifer, having had enough simply picks her up and walks away, coming back with the party to lock the doors of the windmill.

They head off with Adabra on Lucifer’s shoulder kicking and flailing. After a while, she calms down, they make the long trek back, Adabra insisting they travel by road. They set up camp about a day away from Phandalin as the crow flies. They take some well-deserved leisure time. The two wood elves go hunt. Will summons an owl familiar to help him hunt, while our Dragonborn bathes in the river and catches fish.

They sat around the campfire, Adabra, Lucifer and Reignleif started to sing and passed the night talking and singing in mirth.

As Adabra started to trust them more she offered to join their party to which they agreed. So, The heroes set off in the morning towards Phandalin. They arrived by sunrise and entered the town while Adabra talked to her friends in The Order of The Knights.

They split up and went to Harbin Wetser to collect their prize, which he gave them. He was wearing a tuxedo, seemingly waiting for Adabra. The group lied to him about her whereabouts and left.

Meanwhile, the two members of our party that were with Adabra took her to the shrine of luck, Where they found out about the war between The Black Network and The lord’s Alliance. They decided to go to the Lionshield coster and coincidently they met their other party members there.

Now regrouped, they went inside, where Linene Graywind greeted them. She was rather curt and blunt in her words. The characters also meet Kristen Blooms, the young girl working as an assistant of Linene, clumsy but hard-working.

After a few minor purchases, The Heroes are on their way.

They check in to The Stonehill Inn and buy a comfy room for Adabra. And greet the barmaids with a nod as they go to their rooms to sleep after such an exhausting day.
