# **Curses, Coffins, and Greengrass Cheer**

## **Act 1: Near Death & Dread**

We kick things off as our heroes look around, seeing the **Animated Armours** rise again. Their situation looks grim as they try to find a way out but fail to do so. Time is running out as the perceptive **[[Players/Reginleif Spiritwalker/Reginleif Spiritwalker\|Reginleif Spiritwalker]]** looks up and sees what is really causing the never-ending wave of monsters—a **Lich**. He tries to use his soul-knife ability called **Psychic Whispers** to communicate with the **Lich**. Talking to creatures of such low intellect upsets the **lich**, who uses a **9th level spell: Power Word Kill** to instantly kill **[[Players/Reginleif Spiritwalker/Reginleif Spiritwalker\|Reginleif]]**. The party, seeing their ally’s death, panics and scrambles to find an exit. Amid the chaos, the **lich** takes control of **[[Players/Lucifer Morningstar/Lucifer Morningstar\|Lucifer Morningstar]]**’s mind, but before he can attack his allies, **[[Players/Will Buyers/Will Buyers\|Will Buyers]]** casts **Sleep** to render **[[Players/Lucifer Morningstar/Lucifer Morningstar\|Lucifer]]** unconscious.

As the chaos unfolds, our cleric, **[[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar Norixius]]**, touches the coffin in the middle of the battlefield. All lights in the temple turn red as unreadable runes appear on every pillar. Knowing this is the only way out, **[[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar]]** jumps into the coffin and closes the lid. He reads the name of a dead god on the coffin’s lid, and in desperation, says it aloud: **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Gods/Ethalion\|Ethalion]]**. As he does, the lights in the temple grow brighter, and every rune transforms, revealing the name **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Gods/Ethalion\|Ethalion]]**.

**[[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar]]** is transported to the **Ethereal Plane**, where he meets the goddess **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Gods/Ethalion\|Ethalion]]**. She tells him that, as the only one who knows her name, he has allowed her to bypass a special divine rule, **Oblivati Mori**. She explains that the only way to save his friends is to adopt her faith and become her believer to maintain her presence in the material plane. In desperation, **[[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar]]** agrees, and **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Gods/Ethalion\|Ethalion]]** grants him the following:

- **A wish spell**
- **Potion of Healing** (2d4+2 HP), 2d6 x 10 silver pieces
- **Helm of Comprehend Languages**, 3d6 x 10 gold pieces
- **Timekeeper's Hourglass**

Afterward, he emerges from the coffin, using his wish spell to revive **[[Players/Reginleif Spiritwalker/Reginleif Spiritwalker\|Reginleif Spiritwalker]]** and teleport the group out of the forest.

After that ordeal, they flee the forest, hearing the trees whisper around them, knowing they've broken a rule of the gods and brought a dead god back from the dead.

That night, as they travel back, exhausted, they see the stars clustering together as if anticipating something. The sea’s tides shift, and the air grows icy cold. As they sit for what feels like an hour, **[[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar]]** uses the **Timekeeper's Hourglass** and realizes only 10 minutes have passed. Though they try to cheer up, they cannot. They hear a low rumble and feel a tense atmosphere, the tension of a nation on the brink of war.

In the middle of the night, **[[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar]]** is interrupted in his sleep by a visit from **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Gods/Ethalion\|Ethalion]]**. As he inquires what he should do, something strikes her, and she vanishes, bleeding purple.

Shaken, they move on, reaching **[[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Phandalin\|Phandalin]]** by the next evening, where they find the entire village decorated for the **Festival of Greengrass**.

## **Act 2: Rest, Relaxation, and Recursive Intrigue?**

As our heroes enter the gates, they see **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn/Tayla Stonebreaker\|Tayla Stonebreaker]]** buying fruit. After some small talk, **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn/Tayla Stonebreaker\|Tayla]]** takes them to the **[[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn\|Inn]]**, which is almost full. She finds them a table, revealing she's off duty today and joins them. They enjoy the music of **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn/Malukha\|Malukha]]** and a feast paid for by **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn/Tayla Stonebreaker\|Tayla]]**. **[[Players/Will Buyers/Will Buyers\|Will Buyers]]** isolates himself by the door, looking intimidating enough that people mistake him for a bouncer and pay him to enter.

Looking around, they see the **[[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn\|Inn]]** staff working overtime, so they pitch in. **[[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar]]** helps **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn/Martha Stonehill\|Martha Stonehill]]** in the kitchen, **[[Players/Reginleif Spiritwalker/Reginleif Spiritwalker\|Reginleif]]** helps **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn/Alexis Stonebreaker\|Alexis Stonebreaker]]** with accounting, and **[[Players/Aegnor Elessar/Aegnor Elessar\|Aegnor Elessar]]** and **[[Players/Lucifer Morningstar/Lucifer Morningstar\|Lucifer Morningstar]]** serve as waiters.

During the lively night, they notice a suspicious group huddled over a map, discussing economic gain if a shadowy figure called **The Empress** were to rule the Sword Coast. The party tries to eavesdrop, but the group eventually slips away using a **Dimension Door** spell.

Afterward, the party relaxes, then rests for the night. In the morning, they find **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Stonehill Inn/Tayla Stonebreaker\|Tayla]]** looking bored but cheerful as she gifts them **Greengrass** presents:

- **[[Players/Reginleif Spiritwalker/Reginleif Spiritwalker\|Reginleif Spiritwalker]]**: A small emerald cloak
- **[[Players/Will Buyers/Will Buyers\|Will Buyers]]**: A magical component pouch that dispenses items worth up to 10 GP
- **[[Players/Aegnor Elessar/Aegnor Elessar\|Aegnor Elessar]]** and **[[Players/Lucifer Morningstar/Lucifer Morningstar\|Lucifer Morningstar]]**: A box of chocolates
- **[[Players/Balasar Norixius/Balasar Norixius\|Balasar Norixius]]**: A small gold bracelet

Afterward, they head to **[[World/Faerun/Western Lands/West/Sword Coast/Phandalin/Trecendor Manor\|Trecendor Manor]]** to meet **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/The Trecendor Family/Lysander Trecendor\|Lysander Trecendor]]** and inquire about **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra]]**. **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/The Trecendor Family/Lysander Trecendor\|Lysander]]**, busy with paperwork, confirms **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/Adabra Gwynn\|Adabra]]** is still asleep but healthy. He also warns of dangerous rumors about the **Trecendors** spreading in the royal court. **[[Players/Will Buyers/Will Buyers\|Will]]** makes **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/The Trecendor Family/Lysander Trecendor\|Lysander]]** promise to meet him later.

Outside, they see little **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/The Trecendor Family/Cordelia Trecendor\|Cordelia Trecendor]]** on a hill. She shares her plight over a lost bunny, which they help her find. Hugging the bunny, **[[Lore/Dragon Of Icespire Peak/Homebrew/Npcs/Phandalin/The Trecendor Family/Cordelia Trecendor\|Cordelia]]** gifts **[[Players/Reginleif Spiritwalker/Reginleif Spiritwalker\|Reginleif]]** her **Unopenable Locket**, forming a bond with him.
