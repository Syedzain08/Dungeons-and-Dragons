# Will Buyers

**Arcane Prodigy, Human Wizard**

**Current Mission:**

* Will Buyers is driven by a singular, all-consuming purpose – vengeance. The white-hot embers of hatred for dragonkind burn within him, fueled by the fiery demise of his parents at the claws (or rather, breath) of a young white dragon. This cold-blooded predator, Cryovain, stole his childhood and left him with a thirst for retribution that borders on obsession.

**Appearance:**

Despite his youth, Will carries himself with a seasoned weariness. His eyes, once filled with childish wonder, now flicker with a calculating intelligence and a barely suppressed fury. Will's lean frame belies a potent magical aura that crackles around him like static electricity. He favors simple, functional garb, practicality trumping aesthetics in his pragmatic world. Arcane symbols and wards are often etched into his clothing – a constant reminder of his power and his purpose.

**Backstory: A Spark Ignited in Ashes**

The idyllic life Will once knew vanished in an icy inferno. Cryovain, a young white dragon with a taste for destruction, descended upon his village, leaving behind a smoldering crater of ash and grief. A mere boy at the time, Will witnessed the horrific event, the image of his parents consumed by freezing breath forever etched into his memory.

Consumed by an all-encompassing hatred for dragons, Will dedicated his life to mastering the arcane arts. He wandered the land, seeking out scraps of forgotten lore and cryptic rituals, his thirst for vengeance fueling his magical aptitude. He learned the art of summoning, of conjuring icy blasts, of manipulating the very fabric of reality – all with the singular goal of one day confronting Cryovain and exacting his due.

News of Cryovain's escalating attacks on the Sword Coast reached Will's ears. The dragon's presence in Phandalin, a bustling village he'd never called home, became a beacon he couldn't ignore. With a heart steeled by cold resolve, he set his sights on the dragon, ignoring the whispers of prophecies and the potential for greater threats. Cryovain would pay for his crimes, and Will would be the instrument of its fiery demise.

However, fate, it seemed, had other plans. Rumors of a different kind began to circulate - a prophecy hinting at a hero destined for the heart of the Kryptgarden Forest. Though Will scoffed at the notion of heroism, a flicker of unease stirred within him. Could there be a larger threat at play, a force even more malevolent than Cryovain? Regardless, his path remained clear. Whether the Kryptgarden held additional foes or not, it also held Cryovain. With a potent mix of vengeance and pragmatism fueling his every step, Will Buyers ventures into the unknown, a storm cloud brewing on the horizon of Icespire Peak.
