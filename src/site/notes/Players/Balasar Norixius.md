Balasar is a tall and clean looking dragonborn, despite the trend of being bloody in the dragon-kin. He prefers to give life rather than take it. He has a terrifying jaw of a ice dragon causing many to run away in fear. He usually wears a cloak or hood to conceal his face.

**Backstory**

Balasar's mother and father were slain in a brutal attack upon their family home. The grief of these losses led the young dragonborn to seek shelter with an elder dragon. This wise creature served as a guide and protector to the boy, offering comfort and safety in the absence of his birth parents. With the wisdom of the elder dragon, the young dragonborn became a cleric, pledging his life to the protection of others, just as the elder dragon had protected him.

In time, he and the elder dragon came to the Sword Coast, drawn to the city of Phandalin, where they hoped to find a new home.

In the heart of Phandalin, Balasar's path would soon intersect with the tale of Cryovain, a young white dragon that had brought terror and destruction throughout the region. As he settled into his new life, the young dragonborn cleric soon learned of the dragon's menace, and he knew that he was duty-bound to confront this threat and protect the innocent lives that had been affected.

Though the elders and leaders of Phandalin had their own methods to try and deal with Cryovain, Balasar felt that his connection to the elder dragon had given him a deeper insight into the beast's nature.
